The 2023 edition of the Graduate Student Meeting on Applied Algebra and Combinatorics took place in Stockholm, April 26-28. It aimed for graduate students and postdocs interested in algebra and combinatorics and their applications to meet each other, communicate their research, and form new collaborations.

Over the course of three days, participants got the chance to take part in minicourses with interactive exercise sessions, a poster session, several contributed talks, as well as an open problem session.
