Moduli spaces are at the core of many algebraic geometersâ€™ lives, as their geometry encodes the behavior of varieties in families. Studying cycle-theoretic, cohomological and arithmetic invariants of these spaces has proven to be of the utmost importance, with far-reaching applications in enumerative geometry, number theory and theoretical physics. The conference aims at bringing together researchers working on moduli of curves and surfaces, so to start a fruitful contamination of ideas and to foster informal discussions on the compelling open questions in these fields.

Chairpersons: Francesca Carocci, Andrea Di Lorenzo, Michele Pernice
